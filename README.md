# Flipper Zero Geometry Flip
Geometry Dash Demake with level system, basic physics engine, coyote time physics and basic UI. 

## My plans
I am making real ship, ball and ufo physics!
After full engine polishing, there will be UI and Scratch-based editor

## Installation
Download a release (or pre-release to stand in the middle of releases)
Drop to SD Card/apps/Games and also...

Drop some .gflvl levels in SD Card/apps_data/geometry_flip in order to actually play.

## .gflvl
### What?
.gflvl files are basically text with some small things to make a level for the game.

### How?
Check the wiki.

### Where?
For example, my repo includes a Testing.gflvl as an internal-usage mechanic test. Maybe I will add some levels

## Build
Clone and `ufbt`.

## Why it is crap?
I am not a gamedev. Flipper programming may be easier with Python... But I must struggle with C.
